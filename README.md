# How to use it

run: `./main [imagepath]` Should just run. I think :); It's a binary file

# In case it doesn't work

Check:
1. Do you have golang installed? If you do, also make sure you have [GoCV](http://gocv.io/) installed
2. Do you have the right image path?
3. Can your computer even handle the program? ðŸ˜¬
